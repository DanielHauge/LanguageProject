# Problem 2

## Description
Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

```
For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. 
If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].
``` 

## Cases
```
- [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- [3, 2, 1]
- [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128]
- [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]
```
