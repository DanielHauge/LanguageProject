This is a repository for personal learning. The goal is to learn more languages in addition to measuring their speed and comfort level. It includes typical algorithms and some solutions to odd problems in many different languages.

## Algorithms & problems

### P1: Does any two values sum to k in a list?
###### Description
```
Given a list of numbers, return whether any two sums to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17
```
###### Cases
```
k: 17 | list: 10  15  3   7
k: 95 | list: 38	16	94	40	79	78	74	75	61	73	23	13	1	52	89	27	48	86	73	100
k: 150 | list: 5	2	28	22	17	4	32	100	97	53	37	59	78	88	55	45	95	25	67	72	69	40	34	33	51	8	56	80	21	35	54	64	90	39	47	25	7	84	89	89	22	18	23	35	87	73	74	33	92	22
