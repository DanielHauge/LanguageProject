# Dialects of computing
This is a repository for personal learning. The goal is to learn more languages in addition to measuring their speed and comfort level. It includes typical algorithms and some solutions to odd problems in many different languages.

## Procedure
First is to build the algorithm, the goal is to construct the algorithms as identical in each language as possible. However it will be different from language to language. Then to make a single measurements of each case. It should be noted that the measurements can vary alot depending on how many times they are run. For instance, java. If running multiple times, lets say 100000 times. The JVM will predict and pre-calculate the answers before the actual call comes. This will affect measurement results alot. But i'm only going to do a one off calculation, mainly to not exhastively benchmark and generate tons of overhead work, since it needs to be implemented in all languages. Perhaps later down the line.

## Algorithms & problems
