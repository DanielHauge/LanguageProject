# C#
High level language from microsoft. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language))



## Purpose:
C# is a general-purpose object oriented programming language with the main purpose for building applications for windows. It is a fairly wide known and used language.

## Run-time Speed:
To be specified

## Coding comfortability
It is very comfy to code in C#. It is very easy to write code that is structured and is not confusing to understand, unless given effort to complicate unjustifiable. Furthermore, the community is quite big and inspiration and help is easy to find, e.g. StackOverflow.


## Library and tools

- IDE: Visual Studio

Very easy to get going and setup. It is a little clutered and alot is going on. But it is a powerfull IDE, maybe too powerfull for the average hobbyist or even programmer.

- ReSharper
With the extension "ReSharper" from jetbrains, it makes coding C# in visual studio alot better, causing much better quality code and production speed.

- Library:

C# Has many good libraries hence it's popularity. C# is like a jack of all trades. you can build anything, But not specialized for anything other than running on windows. It should be noted, that it is very difficult to get C# applications or other .net languages to run on anything other than windows. Possible with [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/archived/mono_for_net_developers/) as an example.



## Learning process

- **Note:** Extensive prior experience from school and other hobby projects.

It is hard to measure how easy or hard it was to learn this language, since it was the first language together with java i learned. Despite that, i would say C# is one of the easier languages to learn. It has very nice structured syntax with alot of room for "syntatic sugar" when you get to learn more. It is very easy to get things going with C#, however the most likely used IDE "Visual studio" does alot of things for you. So there is still alot of things going on behind the scenes that might not be easy to get first. 

- **Note:** C# and Java will be used as a baseline for further learning evaluation.
